# Snake

A classic Snake game implementation in C++ designed for the Windows console environment.

## Overview

This project is a lightweight console-based Snake game, leveraging Windows-specific system calls for rendering and input handling. It demonstrates fundamental techniques in real-time rendering, direct keyboard input capture, and basic game loop logic within a C++ environment.

## Requirements

- C++17 or later compatible compiler (e.g., MinGW, MSVC).
- Windows operating system (required for `<windows.h>` dependency).

## Build Instructions

To compile and run the project locally:

### Compilation

```bash
g++ snake.cpp -o snake.exe
